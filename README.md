## Project Overview

**Real-Time Streaming Analytics Platform** is a fully local, open-source, production-style AI SOC/XDR system that processes cybersecurity telemetry in real time.

The platform simulates enterprise telemetry, streams it through Kafka, enriches it with Spark Structured Streaming, applies ML-based anomaly detection, correlates incidents, maps detections to MITRE ATT&CK, enriches entities with local threat intelligence, and presents the results through a polished React dashboard and FastAPI APIs.

It is designed to demonstrate practical experience across:

- real-time telemetry processing
- distributed streaming analytics
- AI/ML anomaly detection
- cybersecurity analytics and SOC workflows
- threat intelligence correlation
- observability and platform health monitoring
- Dockerized microservices architecture

Everything runs locally with free/open-source tools. No paid APIs, managed cloud services, or external SaaS dependencies are required.

| **Incident Correlation** | Groups related alerts into incidents with severity escalation and timelines. |
| **Real-Time Alerting** | Streams live SOC alerts and incident updates through FastAPI WebSockets. |
| **Search + Persistence** | Stores structured records in PostgreSQL, indexes searchable data in Elasticsearch, and caches latest values in Redis. |
| **Observability** | Exposes Prometheus metrics and Grafana dashboards for service and pipeline monitoring. |
| **Enterprise Dashboard** | React + TypeScript dashboard for SOC analytics, threat hunting, entities, alerts, incidents, and system health. |

<details>
<summary><strong>Detailed Data Flow</strong></summary>

1. Synthetic producers emit telemetry into Kafka topics.
2. Spark Structured Streaming consumes telemetry and produces enriched analytics and feature streams.
3. ML inference consumes analytics topics and publishes anomaly predictions.
4. The alert engine evaluates prediction and analytics streams to create SOC alerts and incidents.
5. The threat intelligence engine enriches activity with local IOC feeds, MITRE mappings, rule hits, and entity risk profiles.
6. PostgreSQL, Redis, and Elasticsearch persist structured, cached, and searchable records.
7. FastAPI exposes REST and WebSocket APIs.
8. React visualizes dashboards, alerts, incidents, threat intelligence, MITRE coverage, entities, timelines, and observability.
9. Prometheus and Grafana provide platform health and metrics visibility.

## API

The backend is powered by **FastAPI** and exposes production-style REST and WebSocket APIs.

| API Surface | URL |
| --- | --- |
| Backend API | `http://localhost:8000` |
| Swagger Docs | `http://localhost:8000/docs` |
| OpenAPI JSON | `http://localhost:8000/api/v1/openapi.json` |
| Health Check | `http://localhost:8000/api/v1/health` |
| Prometheus Metrics | `http://localhost:8000/metrics` |

Example endpoint groups:

- `/api/v1/dashboard/*`
- `/api/v1/events/*`
- `/api/v1/predictions/*`
- `/api/v1/alerts/*`
- `/api/v1/incidents/*`
- `/api/v1/threat-intel/*`
- `/api/v1/detections/*`
- `/api/v1/entities/*`
- `/api/v1/mitre/*`
- `/api/v1/monitoring/*`
- `/api/v1/ws/dashboard`
- `/api/v1/ws/alerts`
- `/api/v1/ws/threat-intel`

## Local Setup

### Prerequisites

- Docker Desktop
- Python 3.11+
- Node.js 20+
- Git

### 1. Clone The Repository

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd streaming-analytics-system
```

### 2. Environment Setup

The project includes safe example environment files:

```text
.env.example
backend/.env.example
frontend/.env.example
ml-models/.env.example
alert-engine/.env.example
storage-sink/.env.example
threat-intelligence-engine/.env.example
```

Generate private local settings before starting Docker Compose:

```bash
python3 scripts/setup_local.py
```

Docker Compose reads `.env`; keep it out of Git. The setup command preserves an
existing `.env`, generates separate PostgreSQL and Grafana passwords, and chooses
alternate host ports when 5432 or 3000 is occupied. Published services bind to
127.0.0.1. These are development settings; database and Grafana credentials only
initialize new volumes. Never delete existing volumes to change credentials.
See [the baseline audit](docs/PHASE_0_BASELINE_AUDIT.md) for verified results and blockers.

### 3. Start Laptop-Friendly Mode

Windows:

```powershell
.\scripts\start_light.ps1
```

Unix/macOS/Linux:

```bash
./scripts/start_light.sh
```

### 4. Start Full Platform

Windows:

```powershell
.\scripts\start_full.ps1
```

Unix/macOS/Linux:

```bash
./scripts/start_full.sh
```

### 5. Verify Health

```bash
python scripts/health_check.py
python scripts/verify_phase_10.py
```

### 6. Stop Services

Windows:

```powershell
.\scripts\stop_all.ps1
```

Unix/macOS/Linux:

```bash
./scripts/stop_all.sh
```

## Observability

The platform includes a local monitoring stack:

- Prometheus scrapes backend, ML inference, storage sink, alert engine, telemetry producer/consumer, and threat intelligence metrics.
- Grafana provisions local dashboards for system health, streaming pipeline, ML inference, SOC alerting, and threat intelligence.
- FastAPI exposes monitoring APIs for dashboard integration.
- `scripts/health_check.py` validates core service availability.

Example metrics endpoints:

| Component | Metrics Endpoint |
| --- | --- |
| Backend | `http://localhost:8000/metrics` |
| ML Inference | `http://localhost:9101/metrics` |
| Storage Sink | `http://localhost:9102/metrics` |
| Alert Engine | `http://localhost:9103/metrics` |
| Telemetry Producer | `http://localhost:9104/metrics` |
| Telemetry Consumer | `http://localhost:9105/metrics` |
| Threat Intelligence | `http://localhost:9106/metrics` |
